# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
The main difference between `.then` and `.catch` is that `.then`'s code is executed only when a promise is resolved, otherwise if a promise is rejected, `.catch`'s code will execute. They are both used for dealing with promises.
