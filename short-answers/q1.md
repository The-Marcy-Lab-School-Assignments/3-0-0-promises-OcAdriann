# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

The `Outside promise` prints first because the inside promise is still pending and the `Outside Promise` will be logged instantaniously.

Yes! It's important to note that promises always come after synchronous code.
