# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
The `Outside promise` prints first because the inside promise is still pending and the `Outside Promise` will be logged instantaniously.
